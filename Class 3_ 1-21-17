Today I learned about drawing/ writing when coding. You have to set the width along with set the pen down and then pick it back up.
For setting clolors I learned there are a lot of them and each has a unique name. 
A website with a lot of them is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#X11_color_names.
Also when coding you can create shapes to make different logos. 
I would like to create an app or website to spread awareness about global warming.
